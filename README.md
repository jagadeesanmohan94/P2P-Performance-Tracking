From Jan to Jun 2025, the team demonstrated strong productivity, material financial impact, and significant improvement in audit accuracy. The prevention of 179 duplicate payments saved over €64M, reflecting robust process controls and consistent validation outcomes. High‑risk processes such as Duplicate Payments continue to exhibit excellent audit quality with over 90% accuracy and only 9.5% Not‑an‑Error flags, validating the effectiveness of established controls.
Individual performance shows clear segmentation: top performers such as Jagadeesan and Susila delivered flawless 100% accuracy throughout, contributing significantly to quality stabilization and serving as benchmarks for best practices. The majority of the team remained within a 60–76% accuracy range, displaying both strength and areas requiring structured calibration. Users with higher NAE values indicate opportunities for refining judgment consistency and classification accuracy.
Team‑level performance demonstrates resilience with a strong recovery after the March accuracy dip, culminating in a Year‑to‑Month accuracy of 73.30%. This upward trend reflects successful adoption of feedback loops and improved decision alignment. Productivity distribution shows considerable variation linked to process complexity and system‑driven workloads, with Jagadeesan contributing over 90% of total audited volumes—an important insight for resource planning and future workload optimization.
Overall, the combination of strong preventive controls, improving audit trends, and clear performance insights positions the team for continued excellence. Targeted coaching, workload realignment, and leveraging top performers as peer mentors will further elevate process accuracy, reduce audit variance, and sustain risk‑mitigation outcomes in the coming quarters.
